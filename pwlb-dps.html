A two quotes from Fredrik Thylander about changes on PTS gtThis is what we are trying on the PTS. When there are too extreme damage talents, that requires the game to have big health pools for enemies to not trivialize the challenge, and that leads to bullet sponge effect for anyone not running that talent. Twitter (https://twitter.com/Thylander/status/1118496341825429504) And this is very important gtwe are not nerfing all damage talents. gt And all of this comes in a package. 
If you are a DPS main like I am in mid ranks, you know that every time something goes wrong, or almost every time, all the blame is directed at you. You are not “clearing the area”, getting picks and all. It is very common to see tanks and healers switching to DPS characters when something goes wrong, because in their eyes the current DPS players are failing their job. From everything I’ve seen, it is difficult to be a support, too. People often blame supports for not healing enough, not heali. Was just shown that Dancer will be a DPS class. Edit: https://ibb.co/0DCM7Kr. The discussion of the meta in Overwatch is so often centered on what the meta is on PC. This is natural, since PC has the most people playing, and also OWL is played on PC. But it sometimes is a bit misleading, because the meta on console is often completely different. Right now is one of those instances. At the moment, bunker comp is the meta on console. Or at least, the general meta is Orisa, Roadhog, Mercy, Lucio, Hanzo, and Soldier/Widow/McCree. Take a look at this week’s hero pick rates. I have been working on this build (https://imgur.com/a/D0xQiYL) since wt4 and now I feel like it's time to share it since I got all the needed pieces. EDIT 1 : I have tweaked this build a bit to make it a lot better for pvp, I have added notes on each part that you may change if you want it for pvp only Weapons : MG5 (or any LMG of your preference) with Unhinged ( +25% weapon damage, -35% weapon handling ) and Allegro ( +10% rate of fire ) for the mods 10% stability and 2x10%. Edit to add a tl;dr: TTF does more damage per shot than wardcliff (and with the same mag size, more total damage). Wardcliff still has higher DPS for a boss phase, but prospector and other grenade launchers beat both anyway. Just did some testing on Greg in the Titan lost sector. Zenobia D (Impact Casing, Auto Loading, Cluster Bombs) did 10872 (Impact Casing added 216 damage. 7580+2380 Rocket, and three 253+51 Clusters). Wardcliff Coil did 12680 (8 Rockets at 1479+106 each). You two could be great players, maybe even smurfs that want to "own lower ranks and carry", but come on, it is the most tilting thing in the world when you see a duo-queue instalock DPS. amp#x200B; Yes, you paid for the game and you may play whichever hero you want, but just simple statistics, when you're playing in a game that has more DPS mains than tank and support mains combined, yet (typically) only room for 2 DPS players, and both of you pick DPS, you know you basically say "I don't.

Some melee supports could be better, thou. instead of just slapping "more", I wish these actually do have some cons and pros in their effect (looking at you Endurance Charge on Melee stun with oh so proud "10% more" - that was some lazy shit at work). The main problem with Melee builds is LIFE mechanic. Leech. As DPS I always got played at high 2.8k and stayed there. As a support I got placed at 2675. It's not bad, it's where I belong. But playing support is horrible. My team is ALWAYS spread out, nobody groups up, everyone goes in solo and spams need healing. Sometimes I have DPS standing out LoS spamming I need healing and I tell them on voice that I can't heal them there and they just stay up there and die and then complain about it.I have tanks charging into 6 people alone and then complaining.

This week a lot of new players are doing dungeons for the first time and I've noticed from doing pledges on my tank and healer that a lot of the newer DPS players are really struggling. I wanted to share some tips on how you can make dungeon runs much smoother, improve the group's overall damage, and also stay alive better as a DPS: \- Something is chasing me!
